# Maze Creation

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## How to run
In order to run this file from the terminal we have to give the following order

```
python make_maze.py <n> <start_x> <start_y> <seed> <output_file>
```
Depending on the system where the program is run, you may need to write python3.

We can observe that the program receives four parameters:
*The parameter n represents the amount of rows and columns our graph will have
*The parameter start_x represents the x coordinate of our starting position in the graph. 
*The parameter start_y represents the y coordinate of our starting position in the graph. 
*The output_file represents the file where we want to create the coordinates of our maze.
